# 50-days-of-python-challenge

I'm using "50 Days of Python, A Challenge a Day" by Benjamin Bennett Alexander to build my Python skills.
With anything you do in life, the more challenges you face, the better you get. Therefore, to keep imporving and learn new skills in Python I've decided to complete a challenge a day.

The book itself is seperated into the 50-different challenges plus an extra challenge for each day as well.
I'm using VS Code as my IDE

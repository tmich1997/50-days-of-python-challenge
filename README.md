# 50-days-of-python-challenge

I'm using "50 Days of Python, A Challenge a Day" by Benjamin Bennett Alexander to build my Python skills.
With anything you do in life, the more challenges you face, the better you get. Therefore, to keep imporving and learn new skills in Python I've decided to complete a challenge aa day.
